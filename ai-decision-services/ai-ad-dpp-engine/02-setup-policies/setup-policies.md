Lab 2: Configure OCI IAM Policies
===

## 1. Create a *Compartment*

   All OCI resources used to build the Anomaly Detection Solution in this workshop will be provisioned within the same OCI *Compartment*. Create an OCI Compartment (if needed).

   **IMPORTANT**: Note down the compartment OCID and compartment name from the **Compartments** page in OCI Console. Substitute the value of compartment OCID in the *Policies* in Steps [2] & [3] below (**compartment-name**).
    
## 2. Create a *Dynamic Group*

   Go to **Identity and Security** >> **Dynamic Groups**Â and create the following matching rule.
    
   ```
   ALL {resource.type = 'fnfunc', resource.compartment.id = '<compartment-ocid>'}
   ```

   See screenshots below.

   ![](./images/Set-Policy2.png)

   **IMPORTANT**: Substitute the value of dynamic group in the respective policy in Step [3] below (**dynamic-name**).

## 3. Create required *Policies*
    
   Within **Identity and Security**, click on **Policies**. Then click on **Create Policy**. See screenshot below.

   Configure all the necessary policies. For convenience, allow `any-user` to access the resources (see below). You can refine the scope by creating user groups.

   ```
   Allow any-user to manage objects in COMPARTMENT <compartment-name>
   Allow service faas to manage objects in COMPARTMENT <compartment-name>
   Allow any-user to use cloud-shell IN COMPARTMENT <compartment-name>
   Allow any-user to manage repos IN COMPARTMENT <compartment-name>
   Allow any-user to read objectstorage-namespaces IN COMPARTMENT <compartment-name>
   Allow any-user to manage logging-family IN COMPARTMENT <compartment-name>
   Allow any-user to read metrics IN COMPARTMENT <compartment-name>
   Allow any-user to manage functions-family IN COMPARTMENT <compartment-name>

   Allow any-user to manage cloudevents-rules in COMPARTMENT <compartment-name>
   Allow any-user to use cloud-shell in compartment <compartment-name>
   Allow service dataflow to read objects in compartment <compartment-name> where target.bucket.name='staging-bucket'
   Allow service dataflow to read objects in compartment <compartment-name> where target.bucket.name='inferencing-config-bucket'
   Allow service dataflow to read objects in compartment <compartment-name> where target.bucket.name='training-config-bucket'
   Allow service dataflow to read objects in compartment <compartment-name> where target.bucket.name='output-bucket'
   ```
